      Iâ€™m a 90s kid who oscillates between being super excited by technology,
      and wanting to escape it. Perhaps surprisingly, both of these modes have
      proved useful in building software as a career. I like avoiding
      complexity. I try to keep in mind that everything we do is ultimately
      about people; most problems are not technology problems.

      My current job title is â€˜Software Engineerâ€™, but I've also been called a
      â€˜Design Technologistâ€™, â€˜Product Designerâ€™ and â€˜shopping mall retail wage
      slaveâ€™ in the past. Iâ€™m currently working on the <a
        href="https://atlassian.design">Atlassian Design System</a
      > with a bunch of really clever people. You can peep my resumÃ© at <a
        href="https://read.cv/jacklorusso">read.cv</a

      I live in sunny Sydney, Australia with my partner and my two cats, Luna
      and Boof. My little home means everything to me.

      In past incarnations <a href="/">jacklorusso.com</a> has been more of a
      portfolio, or a glorified business card. Now, itâ€™s an old-school blog.
      Somewhere for me to jam on things Iâ€™m interested in and share my <a
