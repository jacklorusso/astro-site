		<p>
			I'm a 90's kid who oscillates between being super excited by technology,
			and wanting to escape it. Perhaps surprisingly, both of these modes have
			proved useful in building software as a career. I like simple solutions to
			complex problems. I try to keep in mind that everything we do is
			ultimately about people.
		</p>
		<p>
			My current job title is 'Software Engineer', but I've also been called a
			'Design Technologist', 'Product Designer' and 'shopping mall retail wage
			slave' in the past. I'm currently working on the <a
				href="https://atlassian.design">Atlassian Design System</a
			> with a bunch of really clever people.
		</p>
		<p>
			I live in sunny Sydney, Australia with my partner and my two cats, Luna
			and Boof. My little home means everything to me.

		<p>
			In past incarnations <a href="/">jacklorusso.com</a> has been more of a portfolio,
			or a glorified business card. Now, it's an old-school blog. A public notebook!
