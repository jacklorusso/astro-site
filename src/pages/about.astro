		<p>
			I'm a 90's kid who oscillates between being super excited by technology,
			and wanting to escape it. Perhaps surprisingly, both of these modes have
			proved useful in building software as a career. I like simple solutions to
			complex problems. I try to keep in mind that everything we do is
			ultimately about people.
		</p>
		<p>
			My current job title is 'Software Engineer', but I've also been called a
			'Design Technologist', 'Product Designer' and 'shopping mall retail wage
			slave' in the past. I'm currently working on the [Atlassian Design
			System](https://atlassian.design) with a bunch of really clever people.
		</p>
		<p>
			I live in sunny Sydney, Australia with my partner and my two cats, Luna
			and Boof. This little home means everything to me.
		</p>
		<h2 class="title">What is this site?</h2>
		<p>
			Good question. I'm still figuring that out myself. In past incantations
			jacklorusso.com has been more of a glorified business
			card/resume/portfolio. For now, it's an old-school blog. A public
			notebook!
