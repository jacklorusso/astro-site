      This is a page about the gear, tech and apps that I rely on. It's taken me
      years to collect and fine tune my setup, but I'm pretty happy with it now!
    </p>
    <h2>Gear</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Remote Projects Easy Tote: my everyday grab-and-go bag</li>
      <li>
        Wilderness Equipment 'Traverse' 33L: big enough for active travel, small
        enough for carry-on
      </li>
      <li>
        Samsonite Hi-Fi Spinner 55: tough, light, and fits even the stingiest
        airline cabin size (looking at you Ryanair/Easyjet)
      </li>
      <li>
        Seiko Prospex SSC807J1: daily driver watch, diver/chronograph,
        sentimental value
      </li>
      <li>G-SHOCK DW5600-1: my beater watch, tough as nails</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tech</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        iPhone 11 Pro Max: been running this since 2019, one battery service
      </li>
      <li>
        MacBook Pro 2019 16-inch: hate the touchbar, keeps me warm in winter
        (and unfortunately summer)
      </li>
      <li>
        Sony WH-1000XM5: best wireless noise-cancelling cans on the market in my
        opinion
      </li>
      <li>
        Jabra Elite Active 8: tough as they come, secure fit for exercise, sound
        and battery life is surprisingly excellent
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Apps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Things 3: finally tried it out after hearing the buzz for years â€” the
        rumours are true, simply elite design
      </li>
      <li>
        Flow: clean little Pomodoro timer with powerful 'focus' options like
        blocking websites, apps
      </li>
      <li>
        Zed: no-frills, super-fast text editor (but still use VS Code for some
        projects)
      </li>
      <li>iTerm2: old faithful, I'll probably never use anything else</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</PageLayout>
