I didn't jump aboard when I first came across the [Astro](https://astro.build) hype train. _Another_ framework / static site generator? Sure. Cool, I guess.

Professionally, I've mostly been using Gatsby and a bit of Next.js when building web sites for the last few years. They're fine.

Gatsby tends to be overkill unless you're sourcing data from many different places — the GraphQL data layer doesn't really shine until it's reducing a whole bunch of glue code. There is a complexity inflection point that you need to get over before Gatsby actually saves you any time and effort. If you're just dealing with some markdown files, it's a little over the top — add in a headless CMS as an additional data source and you might be close to getting bang for your buck

Next.js is great and I don't have anything really bad to say about it, except that it's probably a bit much for a simple static site. It was made for building full-stack web apps, and it handles that use case remarkably well.
