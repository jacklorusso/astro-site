This past weekend, for the first time in a _long_ time, I felt like coding in my spare time.

I haven't always been like this. When I first started out designing and developing for the web, I was captivated by the possibilities that were opening up for me. I couldn't get enough of it. I always had 2 or 3 side projects humming away, I'd be going through courses and tutorials to try and increase my powers, and I'd be ferociously building and tearing down and rebuilding my personal website at all times.

It's an ancient custom for the first post on a new blog to contain at least a little navelgazing. You gotta spend a _little_ time blogging about blogging.
