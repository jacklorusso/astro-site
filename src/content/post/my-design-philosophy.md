Recently I've been thinking about my design philosophy. It might sound grandiose at first, but I believe we all have one, whether it is consciously constructed and employed or not. I asked myself the following questions to unpack my design philosophy.

What are the fundamental beliefs and approaches that inform my practice? What have I taken with me from job to job, or even across crafts â€” from being a designer, to a 'design technologist', to a software engineer? What pieces of writing or talks do I return to time after time, or frequently share with my peers? What ideals were embraced by the most successful and enjoyable projects I've worked on? What was _missing_ in the most frustrating projects I've worked on?

You could ask yourself similar questions if you wanted to interrogate your own philosophy.
