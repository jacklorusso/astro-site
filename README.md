Many thanks to [chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus) for a great Astro theme that kicked me off with many exciting features. I still keep an eye on it to see if anything new and cool has been added to bring into my own site. Thanks for getting me enough functionality to get going and build momentum with my writing and updates!
